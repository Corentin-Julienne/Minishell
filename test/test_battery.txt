# bank of test to be used for testing minishell features (will compare it to bash)

// main findings

1) the redirection can be after or before the cmd, it does not matter at all in bash
2) first the pipes redirections are to be made, then the redirection, then the commands
3) therefore, redirections supersedes (erase) the pipes redirections
4) therefore, the pipe will redirect with an empty input !!! (does not return an error msg normally)

// the goal of this file is to test different cases in bash regarding to intricating commands,
pipes and redirections

// 1) standard case : pipex-like case scenario

cat  < infile.txt | grep truc | wc -l > outfile.txt
exit status : 0

// 2) standard case : redirection, no pipes and single cmd
<infile.txt cat
cat <infile.txt
exit status : 0

// 3) standard case : no redirection, single cmd
wc -l
freeze

// 4) standard case : no redirections, multiple pipes
echo truc | grep t | wc -l
exit status : 0

// 5) tricky case : input redirections between pipes
echo truc | <infile.txt cat | wc -l
exit status : 0

// 6) tricky case : output redirections between pipes
cat <infile.txt | grep test >outfile.txt | wc -l
exit status : 0

// 7) tricky case : redirection between cmd and argument
echo >outfile.txt truc
exit status : 0

// 8 ) tricky case : nothing between two pipes
cat <infile.txt || wc -l
exit status : 0

// 9 ) tricky case : only redirection, no cmd, no pipes
<infile.txt
>outfile.txt
exit status : 0

// 10 ) tricky case : only redirection, no cmd between two pipes
cat <infile.txt | >outfile.txt | wc -l
exit status : 0 

// 11 ) tricky case : redirection without target, between two pipes
cat <infile.txt | grep test > | wc -l
exit status : 258 bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|'
cat <infile.txt | grep test < | wc -l
exit status : 258 bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|'

// 12 ) tricky case : redirection without target, only
<
exit status : 258 bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
>
exit status : 258 bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'

// 13 ) tricky case : redirection without target, followed by other pipes and commands
< | echo truc | wc -l
> | echo truc | wc -l

// 14 ) tricky case : only a pipe, nothing else
|

// 15 ) tricky case : only multiple pipes, nothing else
|||||||||||||||||||||||


// minishell should be able to 

1) execute normal cmds without redirections or pipes
2) execute cmds with redirections
3) execute every combinations of pipes, cmds and redirections
4) execute cmd even if args of cmds are separated by redirections
5) if there is nothing between two pipes, it should NOT work (|| is a metacharacter not implemented in minishell) !!!
6) if there is no cmd but redirections only, it should work !!!
7) case there is only pipes AND/OR redirs without args, we throw : 
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `[next token, newline if it was last token]'
exit status : 258
